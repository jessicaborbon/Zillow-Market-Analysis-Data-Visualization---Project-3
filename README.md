## In this Zillow Market Analysis Visualization, we created an interactive map to display the change in property market value, specifically for single family homes, across 3 different time periods in Phoenix, AZ. We focused on showcasing the difference in property value before and after the Great Recession, the Recovery Period after, and COVID-19.

## On the map there is a toggle feature to showcase one visualization for each period. When you click on each marker on the map, you’ll see the area and the percentage difference of the average property value of that area.

# The data was extracted and transformed in Postgres, transferred to a new csv file and that csv file was used to create the visualization.

# All corresponding files can be found in the main branch of the GitHub page. Here are the files to reference for the final work:
